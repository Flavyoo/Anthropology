			<p>
				Language is an intricate and complex system of symbols such as
				words, sounds, and gestures to convey information and is organized by set rules.
				Language also consists of paralanguage which is a set of noises such as
				laughs, cries, sighs, and yells.

		<li class="list-group-item">
				<p>
					Much of the communication in Language is a form of nonverbal communication.
					Correlation between body movements and communication is very important; For example
					a nod can be interpreted as a greeting or an understanding.

   <h2>Origins</h2>
   <ul class="list-group">
	  <li class="list-group-item">
   <p>
	   Archeologists have found information that points to the orgins of language
	   as far back as 150,000 years ago and extensive use dating back to 50,000 years ago.
	   Archeologists have also found neurological and anatomical features in Homo Sapien fossils
	   that are necessary for speech.

	   Archeological evidence of art, making tools, group cooperation, and hunting
	   support the idea that language was being used many thousands of years ago.

	<h2>Languages in Class and Gender</h2>
	<ul class="list-group">
		<li class="list-group-item">
			Language can differ based on gender and class. Research on the mixed-sex communication
			shows that men try to retain dominance throughout a conversation through commands,
			challenges, and criticism, while women are likely to ask, provide support, and less
			likely to interrupt a speaker.
		</li>
		<li class="list-group-item">
			People of different classes tend to use vernacular that is perceived as more formal
			and therefore thought to be more educated, which the French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu
			stipulated that having a formal language skill can be turned to greater financial
			capital such as higher wages.

			<h4><b>Sociolinguistics:</b></h4>
			<div class="content">
			<p> The study of the ways culture shapes language and language shapes culture,
				particularly the intersection of language and systems of power such as race, gender,
				class, and age.
			<h4>Example</h4>
			<br>In Hip-Hop culture there exist many particular
			instances of sociolinguistics. Interestingly, with the rise of social media, there
			seems to be new dances every year that are invented, and new terms that are coined along with them. Socila media
			helps spread the reach of these dances and terms to people not so familiar with the culture. Eventually some
			of these words are added to the dictionary and officailly become part of the english lanuage. One example
			is the word "bling" which is said to have been invented by Lil Wayne. Recently the new
			word and dance that have been popularized by football player Cam Newton is the "dab" which was initially started
			in the Atlanta Rap Scene. Today most people know of the dab, and probably can do it; thus
			showing how culture in the Atlanta Hip Hop scene has affected people all over the US, and these people are using
			terms such as "dab" which they may have never used had they never known about it.

		<h4><b>Code Switching</b></h4>
		<div class="content">
			<p>Switching back and forth between one linguistic variant and another depending on the cultural context
			</p>
		<h4>Example</h4>
		<br>Many people have different forms of communication when it comes to texting or speaking.
		When it comes to texting people tend to use abbreviations, emoticons to convey feelings, and usually
		these coexist in a less grammatically correct context. This is the case when someone is communicating
		in a non-professional sense. Code switching
		comes along when the person one is communicating with may belong to an institution, an employer, or of different
		generations, where typical abbreviated texts may not work, and messages have to be clear and direct.
		Code switching can also bring on big issues, as sometime students may forget to switch to a correct language
		variant when writing a paper, and therefore represent words like "are" with "r" or "what" with "wht".<br>
