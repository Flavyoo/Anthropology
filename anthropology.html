						<div class="col-sm-3 question question1">
							<h4>How it started?</h4>
							<p>
								The inception of Anthropology dates back to the 18th
								and 19th centuries.
								This was due to European colonial espansion in which
								contact between Europeans and the rest of the world
								had increased. Through these connections both sides
								were introduced to one another's
								culture. Since then, anthropologists have applied
								knowledge of other peoples culture and life to help solve issues
								that are effecting humanity.

							<h4>How Anthropologists work?</h4>
							<p>
							Anthropologists start their work in a local setting, to understand
							the patterns of the daily lives of those people, and to find the
							connections between a particular culture and the rest of the world.
							The main method of work, is called "ethnographic fieldwork", in which
							an anthropologist live with the people of a community for a period
							of time to better understand their lives.

					<h4>Did You Know?</h4>
					<ul class="list-group">

						<li class="list-group-item">
							The word anthropology stems from the greek word anthropos which means "human"
							and "logos" which is associated with ("thought", "reason", or "study").
						</li>

					<li class="list-group-item">

					        <h4><b>Holism:</b></h4>
							<div class="content">
						    <p> The anthropological commitment to consider the full scope
							of human life, including culture, biology, history, and language, across space and
							time.
							<h4>Example</h4>
						    <br>Human development, whether as individuals or as a group, is holistic. Over the course
							of time, the people we become is influenced by our interaction with the environment,
							such as others we associate with, the place we live in, the culture we are born into, and
							decisions that the environment may force upon us or we force on ourselves. Therefore, it is important to
							note and respect the upbringing of others, as we are born into different
							environments, and become different people.

						<h4><b>Globalization:</b></h4>
						<div class="content">
							<p>The worldwide intensification of interactions and increased movement of money, people,
							goods, and ideas within and across national borders.
						<h4>Example</h4>
						<br>One example of the effects of globalization is the high population of Cape Verdean immigrants.
						Interestingly, there are more Cape Verdeans who live outside of Cape Verde than the entire population of Cape verde; this
						has been made possible through advancement in technologies that have permitted the increase in immigration of
						Cape Verdeans to many parts of the world. As a result, many Cape Verdeans work hard in countries like the US
						and send money, clothes, presents, and provide jobs by building houses and starting business back home.<br>
