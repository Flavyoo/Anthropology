  			  <h2>What is Race?</h2>
  			  <p>
  			  Race is a flawed system of classification, with no biological basis, that uses certain
  			  physical characteristics to divide human population into supposedly discrete groups.
  			  These physical characteristics may include skin color, hair texture, eye shape,
  			  etc.

  				  <h3>One Race!</h3>
  				  <p>Genetically there is only one race, the human race. Anthropologists
  				  consider the categories of race such as black, white, hispanic, etc,

  				  <h3>Origins of Race</h3>

				  <ul class="list-group">
				<li class="list-group-item">
  				  <p>Race was originally created by Western Europeans during their
  				  global expansion starting in the 1400's. Europeans put colonized people into an "international hierarchy of races, colors,
  				  religions, and cultures"(Trouillot 1994, 146).</P>

					</li>
  					  <li class="list-group-item"><p>Classification of people
  					  into different hierarchy such as skin color, was responsible
  					  for the transportation of more than ten million Africans throughout the course of the
  					  trans-Atlantic slave trade. In the beginning planters used indentured servants
  					  and slaves which constructed and grew colonial life and the economy.
  					  However, due to fears that the white indenture servants who became free would rebel, planters imported more
  					  slaves to take place of these servants. In order to gain leverage over the indentures servants,
  					  Africans were taken to be of lesser human than the indentured servants. This resulted in greater racism
  					  and the ability for the indentured servants to have something to separate themselves from slaves(their skin color) and not
					  be considered as part of the same class as slaves who were black.

					  Human variations are gradual and change with geographic regions. Therefore if

					  <br>Racism has lead to horrendous crimes in history. Believing that one race is inferior
					  to another has lead to the genocide of Native Americans, Africans throughout the Trans Atlantic
					  slave trade, hate crimes, etc. Even today racism still exists, as institutional racism is a big issue
					  in society. Institutional racism has lead to movements like Black Lives Matter(BLM) to fight injustice in
					  the black community.

					  <br>Institutional racism has bases in discrimination in the justice system, healthcare, and schools.
					 Some people of different groups get profiled more than others. People of Middle Eastern descent tend to
					 be subjects of racial profiling at airports since people tend to associate them with past occurences like
					 9/11 and "radical Islam". In the justice system, African Americans have been noticed to be given harsher sentences
					 than whites, and you will find higher ratios of blacks in prison than other races, having some cases
					 be due to racial profiling. People belonging to different minority classes tend to have lower quality healthcare.
					 One example is sending sick patients to lower quality institutions for treatment or denying patients because they <!DOCTYPE html>

  			  resources and oppurtunites.

  				  In Brazil there are hundreds of racial classifications. These stem from different shades
  			      of skin color. Some include alva (pure-white), alva-escuro("off-white"),
  		          branca("white"), cafe("coffeee colored"), cafe con leite("coffee with milk"), and
  	              pretinha("lighter black"), to say the least. Brazil's categories of race, is a perfect
  	              example of the flaw in separating people into races. For example, in Brazil you can be part of one race,
  	              but in the united states be considered part of another. In the United states in 1940, the census had eight
			  categories, today it has fourteen race categories. This shows that race is not natural, but created by humans.</li>

  				  <h3>Race is Social and Economic.</h3>
  				  <p>Throughout history race has absolutely been an influence on the
  				     lives of people from many different backgrounds. Most importantly, people's
  			         skin color, and other physical traits has lead their lives; Race has determined what
  		             schools people go to, what fountain they can drink from, where they sit on a bus, who they marry,
  					 how much they learn, and in a Demoractic Republic like
  	                 the United States, it has determined who gets to choose who becomes their leader. It perhaps
  	                 has been the one of the biggest flaws in human history, leading to exploitation of millions of lives,
                       extermination of many more millions, belittling, dehumanization, and to this day,
  					 roots from the beginning of race and racism is till lingering in our society. For example, African Americans make up most of the
                       prison population (when compared to total population of different groups in the US). Instances like these have
                       lead to socail and econmic problems amongs familes of African Americans. These include growing up without a father,
                       lack of education, which some can argue is a big influence on a child's life, as there is no positive role model for guidance.
                       The economic disparity between people of different races is also very clear, as white households
                       bring in more money than African American households. This can be due to lack of college education amongst
                       black families, which could be a result of lack of resources and economic issues.</P></li>-->
